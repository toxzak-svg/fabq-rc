# FABQ-RC

Fisher-Adaptive Binary Quantization with Residual Codebooks.

This repository is an active research prototype for sub-byte LLM
quantization. Treat the current state as a validated prototype plus known
gaps, not as a final benchmark release. The strongest checked-in evidence is
in `results/`, `docs/validation/VALIDATION_MEMO.md`, and `paper/`.

## Current Status

- Method and format specs are organized under `docs/specs/`.
- Validation notes live under `docs/validation/`.
- Measured benchmark and runtime artifacts live under `results/`.
- Quality-first benchmark helpers live in `benchmarks/benchmark_quality.py`.
- Paper and Substack drafts live under `paper/`.
- Historical notebook repair/extraction material is preserved under
  `artifacts/` and `scripts/notebook-maintenance/`.

Key caveat: the checked-in evidence does not support a validated 1-bit model,
a BiLLM-quality comparison win, or a validated 27B GGUF quality claim. Use the
validation memo, the preprint, and the result files as the source of truth
before making publication or model-card claims.

## Reproducible Evidence Snapshot

The current public-facing claim should be the measured negative-result framing
from `paper/FABQ_RC_preprint.md` and the June 26, 2026 benchmark JSONs:

| Artifact | Setting | Evidence | Readout |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `results/qwen35_08b_weight_quant.md` | Qwen3.5-0.8B weight reconstruction | FABQ-RC-lite MSE `6.615134e-05` at `1.4010` bpw | Better reconstruction than fixed Q1 blocks, but not a language-quality result |
| `results/fabq_runtime_validation_report.md` | Qwen3-0.6B FABQ-RC-lite dequantized runtime | PPL `3,676,448.8825` at `1.4004` bpw vs dense PPL `35.2165` | Near-binary row-energy allocation fails language quality |
| `results/qwen3_06b_unified_fabq_benchmark.json` | Qwen3-0.6B unified VP/EBQ target 3.0 bpw | PPL `3269.7708` at estimated `3.1151` bpw | Still a quality failure |
| `results/qwen3_06b_unified_fabq_bpw4_benchmark.json` | Qwen3-0.6B unified VP/EBQ target 4.0 bpw | PPL `67.4850` at estimated `4.1432` bpw | Improved but still materially behind dense |
| `results/qwen3_06b_unified_fabq_bpw45_benchmark.json` | Qwen3-0.6B unified VP/EBQ target 4.5 bpw | PPL `42.5027` at estimated `4.5255` bpw | Best current local quality smoke, not a 1-bit result |

All runtime measurements above are dense-dequantized validation runs over a
small WikiText-2 slice. They prove that the harness can load, quantize,
dequantize, run forward passes, and generate short samples. They do not prove
native compressed-kernel speedups, leaderboard-quality perplexity, or task
accuracy.

## Main Entry Points

- `docs/specs/FABQ_RC_SPEC.md` - primary FABQ-RC method specification.
- `docs/specs/FABQ_RC_GGUF_SPEC.md` - root GGUF format draft.
- `docs/validation/VALIDATION_MEMO.md` - claim audit and validation gaps.
- `results/qwen35_08b_weight_quant.md` - measured Qwen3.5 0.8B weight
  quantization summary.
- `results/runtime_validation_report.md` and
  `results/fabq_runtime_validation_report.md` - runtime validation reports.
- `paper/FABQ_RC_preprint.md` - conservative technical-report draft.

## Validation Guidance

Before presenting FABQ-RC as a release-ready result, check:

1. Storage accounting against `docs/validation/VALIDATION_MEMO.md`.
2. Quality/task-accuracy benchmarks first; use perplexity only as a diagnostic.
3. Whether the full Fisher calibration and residual-codebook path has been
   benchmarked, not only row-energy or forward-imatrix proxies.
4. Whether the GGUF spec being referenced is the intended canonical version.

The project has useful negative and prototype results, but the README and
model-card claims should stay conservative until those checks are complete.
